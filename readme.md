# Team 2 Currency Analysis Dashboard

Our approach to this project was,
- Store all the data in a mongoDB instance
- To create an API that use the parameters(destination currency, from date, to date) from the front end, and make appropriate requests to the database instance. This API will return the response in JSON format
- A simple React UI which uses axios library to make an API call, and renders the chart accordingly
